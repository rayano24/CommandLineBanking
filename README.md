# CommandLineBanking
A console based program that simulates online banking minus any GUI (for now).

Extension of an ATM program. As a result, the currently published code lacks any adequate user system. The main is not clean/compressed and there are no methods to simplify things. tldr; its a mess. Won't push a new version until its rewritten and cleaned up.

To implement;
-Pseudo user account system with registration
-Unrealistically but for fun; encrypt user submitted data with a simple cipher algorithm and store in a text file?
-Console --> GUI
